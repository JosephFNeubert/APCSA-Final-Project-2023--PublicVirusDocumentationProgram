# APCSA-Final-Project-2023--PublicVirusDocumentationProgram
Final project is to propose and create a program to solve something of our choosing in AP Computer Science A. I chose to create a program that (if applied beyond this project) could allow any user to make and find reports regarding websites infected with viruses so that they're can be a record of virus sites to protect all internet surfers.
